### Hate Speech Across reddit Comments

Has there been a rise in hate speech across reddit comments and what are the
impacts of this?

On Saturday, October 27th the deadliest attack on American Jews took place at
the Tree of Life in Pittsbrugh, PA. Days before the massacre, a resident from
Florida sent bombs to high ranking politicians and news sources labeled as
"Fake News" by the current presidential administration. Accompanied by the
massacre and bomb scare are talks about increased hate speech not only in
America but throughout the world. This topic is discussed in detail from [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/hate-speech-tied-to-suspect-in-synagogue-massacre-rekindles-calls-for-regulating-social-media/2018/10/29/38235396-dbd1-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ce84b08fe6fd) article by the Washington
Post. Social media platforms such as reddit, twitter, and facebook have been
taking measures to ban groups and individuals who push their hate speech on said
platforms But has there been a general rise of hate speech across social media?
A redditor has complied all the public comments across reddit from 2005 to March
of 2017 which adds up to just over 300 gigs of workable data. This topic has
been brought up earlier from an [opinion article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/sunday/the-rise-of-hate-search.html)
written by the New York Times. Furthermore, CNN correlates
[hate speech with social media](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/29/tech/social-media-hate-speech/index.html)
. There has even been an academic study done on the [Equality and Freedom of Expression: The Hate Speech Dilemma](https://advance.lexis.com/document/index?crid=75b7861f-aa84-417f-aa6b-5ac36e19272a&pdpermalink=cf2ddd35-4a14-439c-a984-162f91ea08dd&pdmfid=1516831&pdisurlapi=true)
so there must be some type of rise in hate speech on social media. Hopefully
this research and data can display a rise in hate speech from the years 2005
to March of 2017.

#### Analytical Tools

We plan to use [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/65o7py/updated_reddit_comment_dataset_as_torrents/)
dataset that contains all reddit comments from 2007 - 2017.
We plan to find keywords that are related to hate speech in these comments to
first: determine whether or not there has been a rise in hate speech, and
secondly: determine the possible impact of these comments.
